## üìò 1\. Abstract [[Back to Top]](#content)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.

  - **Normal**: Basic tool-use scenarios.
  - **Agent**: Multi-turn interactions involving users and environments.
  - **Special**: Complex scenarios requiring multiple steps or handling infeasible tool calls.
- The data composition is visualized below, showcasing the comprehensive coverage of tool-use capabilities:

## üõ†Ô∏è 4\. Setup [[Back to Top]](#content)

Execute the following command to install the required dependencies for inference and evaluation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üóÇÔ∏è 5\. Data [[Back to Top]](#content)

<span id="load_data">

All data is stored in the data_all directory, divided into English and Chinese parts, which are located in the data_en and data_zh folders respectively. Each folder contains multiple JSON files, named in the format data_{category}.json, where category represents the type of data.

```

## üß† 6\. Inference [[Back to Top]](#content)

<span id="open_source_inference">
</span>

### 6.1 Inference Script

To run inference with cmodels, use the `generate.py` script. This script supports various models, categories, and languages.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python generate.py  --model <model_name>  --model_path <model_path>  
--category <category> --language <language> 
```

Arguments:

- `--model`: Specifies the model to use for inference.
- `--model_path`: Specifies the local path to the model (only for open-source models).
- `--category`: Defines the category of tasks or datasets to evaluate. Available categories can be found in eval_checker/eval_checker_constant.py.
- `--language`: Specifies the language of the input/output. Supported languages: "en" (English), "zh" (Chinese)

<!-- - `--do_sample`: Enable token sampling during generation. Defaults to greedy decoding.
- `--temperature`: ecoding temperature, applicable only with `--do_sample`.
- `--top_p`: Cumulative probability threshold for token sampling, applicable only with `--do_sample`.
- `--max_new_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate, default is 1024. -->

### 6.2\. Inference Examples

for closed-source model

```bash
python generate.py --model qwen-max --category test_all --language zh
```

for local model

```bash
python generate.py --model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-local --model-path /mnt/nas/ckpt/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct --category test_all --language zh
```

### 6.3\. Precautions

* Before running the program, ensure that the environment variable .env file is correctly configured. To invoke OpenAI, you need to use the external network. Configure the environment variables https_proxy and http_proxy. To use the gemini model, you need to use the Japanese proxy.
* The model to be evaluated needs to be mapped in model_inference/inference_map.py. The model invoked through OpenAI can be added to the APIModelInference list, and the customized inference model can be added to the CommonInference list. The name of a local model ends with -local.
* To add a customized evaluation model, add the model class to model_dict by referring to model_inference/model_infer.py.
* Evaluate the open-source model on Hugging Face. You are advised to use LLaMA-Factory to combine LoRA weights and then infer.

## üìà 7. Evaluation [[Back to Top]](#content)

To evaluate the performance of the models, use the `eval_main.py` script. This script supports various evaluation metrics and can be used for both open-source and closed-source models.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python evaluate.py --model <model_name> --category <category> --language <language>
```
